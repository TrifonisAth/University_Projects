# Arithmetic Logic Unit

* This project is a 16bit [ALU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit).

* In computing, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers.  It is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers and graphics processing units (GPUs).

* The inputs to an ALU are the data to be operated on, called operands, and a code indicating the operation to be performed, the ALU's output is the result of the performed operation.

# Implementation

* The project was created using Intel's software [Quartus Prime](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/development-tools/quartus-prime.html) and [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL)

* [Part A](https://github.com/TrifonisAth/University_Projects/tree/main/Digital_systems_design/PART_A) is the starting block where an 1bit ALU is implemented.
* [Part B](https://github.com/TrifonisAth/University_Projects/tree/main/Digital_systems_design/PART_B) is the construction of a control circuit and the implementation of 16 single bit ALU's into a 16bit ALU.
